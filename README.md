<p align="center"> In the fast-paced world of finance, making informed decisions can be the difference between profit and loss. This project harnesses the power of cutting-edge deep learning techniques to predict stock market trends, providing valuable insights that can guide your investment strategies.

Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networksâ€”a specialized form of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) designed to capture and model temporal sequencesâ€”I dive deep into historical stock data to uncover patterns and predict future price movements.

**ðŸŒŸ Key Features**
- **Advanced LSTM Modeling:** I employed sophisticated LSTM architecture to analyze and predict stock prices with impressive accuracy.
- **Comprehensive Data Analysis:** Explore detailed visualizations to track model performance against actual stock prices.
- **Real-World Application:** My approach is designed for practical application, helping investors and financial analysts make data-driven decisions.
  
Whether you're a data enthusiast, a finance professional, or someone curious about the intersection of AI and the stock market, this project offers a comprehensive toolkit for understanding and predicting market behavior.

- To analyze the model's performance through visual comparisons and identify areas for improvement.

### Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn


## Visualizations

1. **Closing Price of the Stock**
The following graph displays the closing prices of the stock over time. This historical data is crucial for training the LSTM model.
